# Welcome to Mappy Python Diaries!

This is a small sample book that I started when my Jupyter notebooks become a giant pile and I thought I would like to have a living archive for them. 
I have been teaching Python to GIS Students since 2018 but Jupyter notebooks entered my life with the pandemic.  I was teaching GIS Programming during Fall 2020 - the semester known as the first officially fully remote semester ever. Teaching programming remotely? I had been teaching online (via Zoom) before the pandemic, but my students had access to a computer lab, they were using the campus full-time. This remote (Fall 2020) is not even close to that remote. So, the question and terror of anxiety hit simultaneously. I spend the Summer of 2020 trying to come up with ideas to find opportunities for students to overcome the challenge of accessibility in places where software and hardware scarcity exists.
Well, you already have the spoiler from the title that I revamped my course in a way that the material can be molded into a format that enables reusing and recycling, which is quite possible through Jupyter notebooks. And here they comeâ€¦
